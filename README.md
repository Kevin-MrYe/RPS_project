# Milestone 1
In this milestone, I uesd the **Teachable Machine** to create machine learning models for Rock, Paper, Scissors. [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is a web-based tool which can be used to create machine learning models for images,sounds and poses.

Just simpily click the Webcam icon and record gestures of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The "Nothing" class represents the lack of option in the image. After training, download the model from the "Tensorflow" tab in Teachable-Machine.
